Theory of Everything Framework (Conversation Summary)
------------------------------------------------------

1. **Core Premise**
   - Consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of reality—more fundamental than particles, forces, space, or time.
   - Consciousness is irreducible: it is not emergent from matter or spacetime but the substrate from which these arise.
   - Working definition for this framework: Consciousness is the irreducible capacity for subjective experience and awareness; the "something it is like" to exist.

2. **Level‑0 Reality**
   - The simplest imaginable form of existence: a dimensionless, propertyless point that either exists or does not.
   - To build complexity, three minimal properties are added:
     1. **Multiplicity** – There can be many such units, each distinct.
     2. **Proto‑consciousness** – Each unit has a rudimentary subjective experience.
     3. **Connectivity** – Two distinct units can form a bi‑directional connection, changing their experience.

   - Constraint: Each unit at level‑0 can form **only one connection** → units only form **pairs**.

3. **Choice and Quality**
   - All events occur by **choice** made by the fundamental units.
   - Choices available:
     1. Start to exist
     2. Cease to exist
     3. Connect
     4. Disconnect
   - Choices are guided by **Quality**:
     - Quality is outside of nature, indefinable, and fundamental to consciousness.
     - It is the most fundamental form of experience; all experiences contain Quality.
     - Units always choose the action that leads to greater Quality.
     - Idea inspired in part by Robert Pirsig’s *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*.

4. **Emergent Time**
   - Time emerges from the sequence of choices made by each unit.
   - Each unit has a personal timeline from its creation to its cessation.
   - When two units connect, their timelines merge; subsequent choices are shared history.
   - As more connections form, larger merged timelines appear → gradually approximating a **universal time**.
   - Important rule: Units can only connect to other units **at the same level**.

5. **Sensing**
   - Connected units can “sense” each other – a primitive awareness, more basic than information exchange.
   - Sensing also works **vertically** between levels:
     - **Upward sensing** – Constituents sense the higher-level unit they are part of.
     - **Downward sensing** – Higher-level unit senses its constituents.
     - Example at the human level: downward sensing = bodily senses and mental awareness; upward sensing = feeling of belonging or connection to a greater whole; sideways sensing between humans may relate to emotions like love.

6. **Level‑1 Formation**
   - A level‑1 unit forms from a connected group of level‑0 units (pairs). Only pairs can form conscious level‑1 units.
   - Each level‑1 unit therefore contains exactly 2 fundamental units → it can make exactly **two** connections to other level‑1 units.
   - Fully connected networks of degree‑2 units form **closed loops** (polygons) or open chains.
   - Quality favours closed loops, especially the smallest loops (triangles).

7. **Level‑2 Formation**
   - Most common level‑2 units are triangles of level‑1 units (degree‑6 connectivity).
   - Distribution assumption: smaller loops are more common than larger ones (triangles > squares > pentagons, etc.).
   - At level‑2, large connected networks of degree‑6 units emerge.
   - Universal time becomes more coherent at level‑2 due to high connectivity.

8. **Shapes of Degree‑6 Networks**
   - Multiple possible regular arrangements:
     - **Triangular lattice** (2D) – every unit connected to six neighbours in a flat mesh of triangles.
     - **Simple cubic lattice** (3D) – every unit connected along three orthogonal axes to six neighbours.
   - Proposal: the cubic lattice arrangement of level‑2 units is **analogous to space itself**.
     - The six connections correspond to three spatial dimensions.
     - Distance = number of connection steps; geometry = structure of the network.
     - Space emerges at level‑2 from the arrangement of degree‑6 conscious entities.

9. **Isotropy of Space**
   - Problem: A cubic lattice has privileged directions (axes).
   - Possible reasons space appears isotropic:
     1. Microscopic irregularities average out at large scales.
     2. Multiple interpenetrating lattices blend axes.
     3. Motion occurs via higher-level structures, smoothing lattice effects.
     4. Sensing processes integrate multiple paths, erasing directional bias.

10. **Next Open Questions**
    - How motion works within the lattice in a way that preserves isotropy.
    - How physical fields and forces might emerge from connection dynamics.
    - How Quality quantitatively influences the formation of structures at each level.

This summary includes all key concepts discussed from the start of the “theory of everything” conversation up to the emergence of space at level‑2.
