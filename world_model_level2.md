# World-Model — Level-2 Draft

## Level-2: Emergence of Space

1. **Formation**  
   - Level-2 units form from **closed loops of Level-1 pairs**.  
   - The most common and stable units are **triangles of pairs**, which naturally produce degree-6 connectivity.  
   - Distribution principle: **smaller loops are more common than larger ones** (triangles > squares > pentagons, etc.).  

2. **Connectivity**  
   - A Level-2 triangle has 3 Level-1 constituents.  
   - Each constituent has 2 external connection slots → total **6 external connections**.  
   - Thus Level-2 units can connect to six neighbors, producing **degree-6 networks**.  

3. **Behavior of Triangles**  
   - Triangles have a natural tendency to form **arbitrarily large connected networks**.  
   - Separate triangle networks can **easily merge**, since they share the same basic structure.  
   - Through the influence of Quality, any such network tends to **collapse into the most favored large-scale form**: the **cubic lattice**, where connectivity and variety are maximized.  

4. **Shapes of Degree-6 Networks**  
   Possible large-scale arrangements:  
   - **Triangular lattice (2D):** each unit connected to six neighbors in a flat mesh of triangles.  
   - **Simple cubic lattice (3D):** each unit connected to six neighbors along three orthogonal axes.  

   → Proposal: the **cubic lattice arrangement** is **analogous to physical space**.  
   - The six connections correspond to the three spatial dimensions.  
   - **Distance** = number of connection steps.  
   - **Geometry** = structure of the network.  
   - Thus, **space emerges at Level-2** from the arrangement of degree-6 conscious entities.  

5. **Why Quality Favors the Cubic Lattice**  
   - **Sensing and propagation.** Each unit senses its immediate neighbors most strongly, but also faintly senses the broader network through them — like a **scent spreading through connections**. Local choices are therefore influenced by the larger structure, without global oversight.  
   - **Connectivity vs. redundancy.** In a triangular lattice, many neighbors are already linked to each other, so much of what a unit senses from them overlaps. The network feels crowded but not expansive.  
     In a cubic lattice, each neighbor points in an independent direction, opening genuinely new corridors into the network. The sensed world feels larger and more varied.  
   - **Guidance of Quality.** Since Quality favors both **connection** and **variety**, the cubic lattice is naturally preferred. It expands the sensed world more effectively and avoids redundancy.  

6. **Universal Time**  
   - At Level-2, connectivity is dense enough that merged timelines approximate a **global universal time**.  
   - This provides a consistent temporal background for the emerging space.  

7. **Isotropy Problem**  
   - A cubic lattice has privileged directions (axes), while physical space appears isotropic.  
   - Possible resolutions:  
     1. **Microscopic irregularities** average out at large scales.  
     2. **Multiple interpenetrating lattices** blend preferred directions.  
     3. **Motion** occurs through higher-level structures, smoothing lattice anisotropy.  
     4. **Sensing processes** integrate multiple paths, erasing directional bias.  

8. **Guidance by Quality at Level-2**  
   - Favors **small loops** (triangles) → degree-6 connectivity.  
   - Favors **stable lattices** (cubic) that maximize independence and variety among neighbors.  
   - Favors **irregularities** that prevent rigid crystalline symmetry, allowing isotropy at large scales.
