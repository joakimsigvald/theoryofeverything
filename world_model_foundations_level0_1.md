# World-Model Combining Consciousness, Quantum Physics, Cosmology, and Life  
### Working Draft — Foundations through Level-1

---

## Core Premise

- **Consciousness is fundamental.**  
  Consciousness is the irreducible substrate of reality — more basic than matter, energy, space, or time.  
  We do not need to explain *why* it exists, because it is directly known through our own awareness.

- **World-building approach:**  
  Complexity emerges step by step from the simplest possible entities (Level-0 units), guided by a fundamental principle called **Quality**.

## Level-0: Fundamental Units

1. **Definition**  
   - Level-0 reality consists of simple, dimensionless proto-conscious units.  
   - Each unit:  
     - Exists or does not exist.  
     - Is distinct from other units (*multiplicity*).  
     - Has a rudimentary subjective awareness (*proto-consciousness*).  
     - Possesses the capacity for **exactly one connection**.

2. **Choice**  
   - Units undergo transitions: to exist, to cease, to connect, or to disconnect.  
   - *Choice* = the primitive act of actualizing one possibility over another.  
   - *Time* emerges as the ordered sequence of such choices.  

3. **Quality**  
   - Quality is irreducible, indefinable, and fundamental.  
   - It is both:  
     - The *force* that guides choices.  
     - The *ideal* toward which choices tend.  

   **Effects of Quality at Level-0:**  
   - Favors **connection** over isolation.  
   - Favors **stability** over fragility.  
   - Favors **variety** (maximizing potential / degrees of freedom).

## Level-1: Pairs

1. **Formation**  
   - Two Level-0 units can connect to form a **pair** (a Level-1 unit).  
   - Each pair inherits the connectivity of its constituents → exactly **two external connections**.

2. **Connectivity Law**  
   *The number of external connections available to a unit = the number of its Level-0 constituents.*  
   - Level-0: 1  
   - Level-1 (pairs): 2  
   - Larger structures: scale accordingly.  

3. **Guidance by Quality**  
   - **Connectivity:** favoring loops over open chains (loops are more internally connected).  
   - **Variety:** disfavoring redundant double-connections; pairs prefer linking to different neighbors.  
   - **Stability:** favoring the smallest loops (triangles) over longer loops or open chains.  

4. **Timelines**  
   - Each pair inherits the linear timeline of its constituents.  
   - When pairs connect, their histories synchronize.  
   - Temporal order is always preserved (no retroactive change, no paradoxes).  

5. **Sensing**  
   - Pairs have primitive awareness of one another:  
     - **Lateral sensing:** awareness of neighbors.  
     - **Upward sensing:** constituents sense the larger unit they form.  
     - **Downward sensing:** the larger unit senses its constituents.

## Special Cases

- **Connectivity-4 chains (two pairs double-connecting):**  
  Either impossible (a “short circuit”) or strongly disfavored by Quality, because they reduce variety.  

- **Higher even connectivities (6, 8, 10 …):**  
  In principle possible, but:  
  - **Statistically rare** (longer chains less likely).  
  - **Qualitatively disfavored** (less stable, less internally connected).  
  - Makes **triangles (degree-6)** the natural attractors.
