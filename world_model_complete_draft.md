# A World-Model Combining Consciousness, Quantum Physics, Cosmology, and Life

## Glossary of Core Terms

### Fundamentals
- **Quality** — guiding principle outside nature; influences choices toward *connection*, *variety*, and *stability*.  
- **Choice** — the act of a conscious entity selecting between alternatives.  
- **Sensing** — the ability of a unit to perceive its neighbors and, indirectly, the broader network.  

### Structural Hierarchy
- **Unit** — general term for a conscious entity at any level.  
- **Level-0 Unit (Point)** — fundamental conscious entity; can form exactly one connection.  
- **Pair (Level-0 Composite)** — two Level-0 units linked; the first emergent structure.  
- **Loop (Level-1 Composite)** — closed chain of pairs. Loops can vary in length:  
  - **Triangle** (3 pairs → degree-6 connectivity)  
  - **Square** (4 pairs → degree-8 connectivity)  
  - Longer loops possible.  

### Level-2 Forms
- **Cubic Lattice (Space)** — extended 3D network formed by triangles; the basis of space-like structure.  
- **Cubic Cage** — finite 3D body formed by six squares stitched together; proto-particle candidate.  
- **Torus** — closed 2D surface formed from square loops stitched into a ring; another proto-particle form.  

### Conceptual Tools
- **Point-like Abstraction** — treating higher-level units as single nodes with outward connections.  
- **Composite View** — showing the detailed internal structure of a unit to explain connectivity.  
- **Layered Reality** — all levels remain real and active; higher levels emerge without erasing lower ones.  
- **Nested Sensing** — higher-level units sense their constituents, and constituents sense the wholes they form.

## 1. Fundamentals

Our starting assumptions are:

1. **Consciousness exists.** We do not attempt to explain *why* it exists, but begin with the fact that we are conscious.  
2. **Quality exists.** It cannot be fully defined, but can be described through its effects: it guides choices toward connection, variety, and stability.  
3. **Choice.** Conscious entities make choices. These choices establish relationships and generate time.  
4. **Time.** Emerges from the sequence of choices. Each unit experiences a timeline of its own.  
5. **Sensing.** Units sense their neighbors, and indirectly the local network, like a scent that weakens with distance.

## 2. Level-0: Fundamental Units

- **Nature:** Level-0 units (Points) are the most basic conscious entities. Each can make and maintain **exactly one connection**.  
- **Pair Formation:** Because each unit can only form one connection, the first stable emergent form is the **Pair**.  
- **Choice:** A unit’s only choice is whom to connect with.  
- **Quality’s role:**  
  - Promotes *connection* (units do not remain isolated).  
  - Promotes *variety* (Pairs prefer distinct partners over double-links).  
  - Guides toward *stability* in these minimal forms.  
- **Reality:** All Level-0 units remain real and active even as higher levels emerge.

## 3. Level-1: Pairs & Loops

- **Constituents:** Level-1 emerges when **Pairs** connect.  
- **Connectivity Rule:** Each Pair can form **two connections**, leading to threads or closed **Loops**.  
- **Loops vs Threads:**  
  - Loops are **favored by Quality** because they maximize internal connectivity and variety.  
  - Open chains are less stable.  
- **Timelines:** Each unit has its own linear timeline. Connections synchronize timelines between units, allowing coherent relational time.  
- **Forms:**  
  - Triangles (Loops of 3 Pairs) → 6-degree connectivity.  
  - Squares (Loops of 4 Pairs) → 8-degree connectivity.  
  - Longer Loops possible, but less stable.

## 4. Level-2: Space & Quadratic Shapes

### 4.1 Triangles and the Cubic Lattice (Space)
- **Triangles** (degree-6 Loops) can merge into networks.  
- These networks have a strong tendency to collapse into the **3D cubic lattice**, rather than 2D lattices.  
- **Why favored by Quality:**  
  - Higher connectivity offers richer sensing.  
  - Cubic symmetry allows greater stability.  
- **Result:** Emergence of **space-like structure** — infinite, open, extensible.  
- **Relative frequency:** Most Level-1 Loops (especially triangles) contribute to the space-like cubic lattice, forming the universal backdrop.  

### 4.2 Squares and Particle-like Structures
- **Squares** (degree-8 Loops) open the possibility of finite, closed forms.  
- **Cubic Cage:**  
  - Six squares stitched into a cube-like shell.  
  - Corners paired across diagonals → closed, self-contained.  
  - Represents the first **finite 3D body** at Level-2.  
  - Candidate for **proto-particles**.  
- **Torus:**  
  - Squares can form rings, then close into a donut-shaped surface.  
  - Represents a **finite 2D closed surface**.  
  - Suggests another class of **particle-like forms**.  
- **Relative rarity:** These square-based structures are statistically less common than the triangle lattice, but significant because they introduce localized finite bodies.  

### 4.3 Visualization Strategy
- **Point-like Abstraction:** Higher-level units can be treated as nodes with outward connections for simplicity.  
- **Composite View:** Used when internal structure explains stability or connectivity (e.g. cubic cage).  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Switch perspective depending on explanatory need.  

### 4.4 Ontological Position
- **All levels persist.** Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 remain real and alive.  
- **Abstraction at higher levels.** For analysis, higher levels are modeled as point-like.  
- **Nested sensing.** Higher-level units sense constituents, and lower-level units sense the wholes.  
- **Result:** A layered but unified ontology.

- **Forces:** How do interactions between particle-like structures manifest?  
- **Fields:** Can extended square or triangular structures act as fields?  
- **Quantitative Quality:** How to formalize Quality’s influence mathematically?  
- **Emergence:** What novel forms appear at Level-3 and beyond?
