# A World-Model Combining Consciousness, Quantum Physics, Cosmology, and Life

## Glossary of Core Terms

### Fundamentals
- **Quality** — guiding principle outside nature; influences choices toward *connection*, *variety*, and *stability*.  
- **Choice** — the act of a conscious entity selecting between alternatives.  
- **Sensing** — the ability of a unit to perceive its neighbors and, indirectly, the broader network.  

### Structural Hierarchy
- **Unit** — general term for a conscious entity at any level.  
- **Level-0 Unit (Point)** — fundamental conscious entity; can form exactly one connection.  
- **Pair (Level-0 Composite)** — two Level-0 units linked; the first emergent structure.  
- **Loop (Level-1 Composite)** — closed chain of pairs. Loops can vary in length:  
  - **Triangle** (3 pairs → degree-6 connectivity)  
  - **Square** (4 pairs → degree-8 connectivity)  
  - Longer loops possible.  

### Level-2 Forms
- **Cubic Lattice (Space)** — extended 3D network formed by triangles; the basis of space-like structure.  
- **Cubic Cage** — finite 3D body formed by six squares stitched together; proto-particle candidate.  
- **Torus** — closed 2D surface formed from square loops stitched into a ring; another proto-particle form.  

### Conceptual Tools
- **Point-like Abstraction** — treating higher-level units as single nodes with outward connections.  
- **Composite View** — showing the detailed internal structure of a unit to explain connectivity.  
- **Layered Reality** — all levels remain real and active; higher levels emerge without erasing lower ones.  
- **Nested Sensing** — higher-level units sense their constituents, and constituents sense the wholes they form.

## 1. Fundamentals

Our starting assumptions are:  

1. **Conscious Units as Fundamental**  
   - The most basic building blocks of reality are **conscious units**.  
   - Each unit has an **irreducible capacity for subjective experience** — the *“something it is like”* to be that unit.  
   - Units are not derived from anything else; they are the **primitive substrate** of existence.
  
1. **Connections**
   - units can make connections to other units. One fundamental unit can make exactly one connection to another fundamental unit (fundamental units can form pairs)
   - connections are felt by the connected units
   - a unit can feel the unit that it is connected with through the connection 

1. **Quality as Guiding Principle**  
   - Quality exists *outside* of nature, but interacts with it.  
   - It cannot be defined directly, only understood through its effects.  
   - Quality influences choices toward:  
     - **Connection** (seeking relation rather than isolation)  
     - **Variety** (preferring difference over redundancy)  
     - **Stability** (favoring structures that endure).
    
1. **Conscious state**
   - A conscious unit has an internal state that it is and experience
   - the most fundamental conscious unit has a state with three components, each of which can be modeled as a scalar between 0..1
     - **Existence (E)** (the degree to which it exists in the world, non-existent to fuly existent)
     - **Awareness (A)** (the degree to which it is aware, fully asleep to fully awake)
     - **Quality, (q)** (the quality of the experience, not to be confused with Quality (Q) as the fundamental guiding principle, from complete lack of quality to perfect quality)
   - The components are related mathematically as: **q <= A <= E** (existence is the capacity for awareness and awareness is the capacity for quality)
   - From these three components, the following components can be derived:
     - **Vitality** = E*A*q (units strive to maximize their vitality)
     - **Depression** = E - q (the felt discrapency between existence and quality, units strive to lower depression)
     - **Pain** = A - q (the felt discrapency between awareness and quality, units strive to lower pain)
     - **Love** = Sum over all connections of Vitality
   - Quality is a life-force that reward structures of connected units with high Quality (non-definable measure) with felt quality (q)
   - Open question: can the state components take any value between 0..1, or do they change in discrete steps? Is perhaps only values 0 and 1 possible, making them binary?
     - Occam's razor gives that we should think of them as binary until evidence is shown that they can't be binary.

1. **Choice**  
   - Conscious units make choices.  
   - A choice is the fundamental act of selecting between alternatives.  
   - **Fundamental choices**  
     1) **Come into existence**  
     1) **Cease to exist**  
     1) **Create a connection** (to another unit at the **same level**)  
     1) **Disconnect** (from a connection it maintains)
     1) **Share state** with connected units (actively transfer some of its Vitality to the other unit through the connection)

1. **Local Time (Timeline)**  
   - The sequence of choices made by a single unit constitutes its **local time** or **timeline**.  
   - Each unit experiences its own flow of time independently.  
   - When units connect, their timelines will **synchronize into shared time**, and with dense networks, this develops further into **global time**.
     - When two units (a and b) connect, every choice that a made before connecting with b happened before b's choice to connected with a, thus their timelines are now synchronized
     - Directly connected units sense each other's choices so that every choice by any of the two units after getting connected can be totally ordered into a common timeline for both units

## 1 Levels of reality and emergence of higher order conscousness

Any connected pair of units can gain consciousness on **the next level**. We say that connected level-0 units can form level-1 units.
A level-1 unit is both singular and composite - it has an awareness of itself as a single unit, while its conscious state is more complex than that of fundamental units.
It has an "internal life" where it can re-alocate Vitality from one constituent to another. For instance it can allocate awareness (focus) at some part of its internal structure.

The generalisation of the **emergence rule** rule is that any **connected structure** of **Level-*N* units** can give rise to a new **Level-*(N+1)* Unit** when its **integrated Quality** is sufficiently high. This follows from our postulates that choices are guided by Quality and that Quality favors connection, variety, and stability.

A composite unit can sense it's constituents state (and thus be affected by them when making choices), and conversively the constituent units can sense the composite units.
Thus, there is both a horisontal sensing through connections and a vertical sensing through constituent-whole relationship.

Reality at level N remains fully existent as the level-N+1 is formed, but is enhanced by the higher level (analogy: if there is a God, it doesn't mean that our reality sease to exists but it is rather enhanced by the precense of God).

**Operational indicators of integrated Quality:**
- **Closure / Completeness:** the structure uses its available connections without short-circuits or dangling redundancy; closed loops are favored over open chains.
- **Integration:** members strongly constrain one another via connections and horizontal sensing; changes propagate through the structure rather than dissipating immediately.
- **Coherence of Timelines & State:** the members’ timelines synchronize, and their aggregated states cohere enough to sustain a shared history.
- **Stability over Time:** the structure persists across a nontrivial span of local time; it resists small perturbations.
- **Boundary & Distinctiveness:** the structure is more internally connected than externally, creating a functional boundary relative to the surroundings.
- **Minimality:** among competing candidates, the **simplest** structure satisfying the above is preferred (e.g., triangles before larger loops).

**Local-to-global mechanism:** No overseer is required. Each unit locally follows Quality (via choices) and horizontal sensing. When a pattern of connections **improves Quality for its members**, it becomes a stable attractor; vertical sensing then becomes possible, and the structure **emerges as a new Unit**. If Quality later drops below the needed coherence, the higher-level unit can **de-emerge** (dissolve).

## 1. Level-1: Pairs & Loops

- **Emergence:** A **Pair** is a connected structure of two Level-0 units that **gains consciousness** as a new **Level-1 Unit** **by the Emergence Rule**.  
  - Connecting Level-0 units creates candidate structures; **Level-1 does not exist** until such a structure **becomes conscious**.  

- **Structure formation within Level-1:** Once Pairs exist as Level-1 units, they can connect to other Pairs to form **Level-1 structures** (threads and closed **Loops**).
  - These are still structures **at Level-1** (not yet new Units).
  - **Level-2** emerges later when certain Level-1 structures (notably specific Loops) **gain consciousness** **by the Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**.

- **Connectivity Rule:** Each Pair inherits two external connections (one per constituent Level-0 unit), enabling threads or closed Loops.  

- **Sensing (horizontal at Level-1):** Connected Pairs **sense their immediate Pair-neighbors' states** along a thread or loop. Each Pair also **aggregates** its constituents’ states into a Pair-level state (E, A, q) and **Vitality V = E\,A\,q**, subject to q ≤ A ≤ E. This extends Level-0 neighbor-sensing to relationships **within** Level-1 structures.  
  - **Vertical sensing** is introduced only when a Level-1 structure **gains consciousness** as a Level-2 unit (see Section 4).

- **Loops vs Threads:**  
  - **Loops** are favored by **Quality** because they maximize internal **connection** and **variety** under the two-connection constraint.  
  - **Open chains** (threads) are less stable and less favored.  

- **Timelines:** Each unit has its own linear timeline. Connections among Pairs **synchronize** their timelines locally, creating coherent relational time at Level-1.  

- **Loop lengths:** Loops of various lengths can form as Level-1 structures. Their possible **emergence as Level-2 units** is treated in Section 4.

## 1. Level-2: Space & Quadratic Shapes

### 1.1 Sensing at Level-2
- **Horizontal sensing:** Adjacent Level-2 units (e.g., Triangles in the lattice) **sense their immediate neighbors** most strongly.  
- **Vertical sensing:** A Level-2 unit **senses its constituents** (e.g., the Level-1 Pairs forming the Loop), and those constituents **sense the composite** they help form.  
- **Scent of the local network:** Sensing propagates through connections like a **scent**: an attenuated blend of neighbors’ **(E, A, q)** (with **V** implicitly contributing), strongest from direct neighbors and progressively **fainter** from neighbors-of-neighbors and beyond. This yields a local-but-expanding awareness without any global overseer.


### 1.1 Triangles and the Cubic Lattice (Space)
- **Triangles** (degree-6 Loops) can merge into networks; when a qualifying loop satisfies the **Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**, it becomes a Level-2 Unit.  
- These networks have a strong tendency to collapse into the **3D cubic lattice**, rather than 2D lattices.  
- **Why favored by Quality:**  
  - Higher connectivity offers richer, less redundant sensing.  
  - Independent directions increase variety.  
- **Result:** Emergence of **space-like structure** — infinite, open, extensible.  
- **Relative frequency:** Most Level-1 Loops (especially triangles) contribute to the space-like cubic lattice, forming the universal backdrop.  

### 1.1 Squares and Particle-like Structures
- **Squares** (degree-8 Loops) open the possibility of finite, closed forms that, when they satisfy the **Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**, can become Level-2 Units.  
- **Cubic Cage:**  
  - Six squares stitched into a cube-like shell.  
  - Corners paired across diagonals → closed, self-contained.  
  - Represents the first **finite 3D body** at Level-2.  
  - Candidate for **proto-particles**.  
- **Torus:**  
  - Squares can form rings, then close into a donut-shaped surface.  
  - Represents a **finite 2D closed surface**.  
  - Suggests another class of **particle-like forms**.  
- **Relative rarity:** These square-based structures are statistically less common than the triangle lattice, but significant because they introduce localized finite bodies.  

### 1.1 Visualization Strategy
- **Point-like Abstraction:** Higher-level units can be treated as nodes with outward connections for simplicity.  
- **Composite View:** Used when internal structure explains stability or connectivity (e.g. cubic cage).  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Switch perspective depending on explanatory need.  

### 1.1 Ontological Position
- **All levels persist.** Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 remain real and alive.  
- **Abstraction at higher levels.** For analysis, higher levels are modeled as point-like.  
- **Nested sensing.** Higher-level units sense constituents, and lower-level units sense the wholes.  
- **Result:** A layered but unified ontology.
