# A World-Model Combining Consciousness, Quantum Physics, Cosmology, and Life

## Glossary of Core Terms

### Fundamentals
- **Quality** — guiding principle outside nature; influences choices toward *connection*, *variety*, and *stability*.  
- **Choice** — the act of a conscious entity selecting between alternatives.  
- **Sensing** — the ability of a unit to perceive its neighbors and, indirectly, the broader network.  

### Structural Hierarchy
- **Unit** — general term for a conscious entity at any level.  
- **Level-0 Unit (Point)** — fundamental conscious entity; can form exactly one connection.  
- **Pair (Level-0 Composite)** — two Level-0 units linked; the first emergent structure.  
- **Loop (Level-1 Composite)** — closed chain of pairs. Loops can vary in length:  
  - **Triangle** (3 pairs → degree-6 connectivity)  
  - **Square** (4 pairs → degree-8 connectivity)  
  - Longer loops possible.  

### Level-2 Forms
- **Cubic Lattice (Space)** — extended 3D network formed by triangles; the basis of space-like structure.  
- **Cubic Cage** — finite 3D body formed by six squares stitched together; proto-particle candidate.  
- **Torus** — closed 2D surface formed from square loops stitched into a ring; another proto-particle form.  

### Conceptual Tools
- **Point-like Abstraction** — treating higher-level units as single nodes with outward connections.  
- **Composite View** — showing the detailed internal structure of a unit to explain connectivity.  
- **Layered Reality** — all levels remain real and active; higher levels emerge without erasing lower ones.  
- **Nested Sensing** — higher-level units sense their constituents, and constituents sense the wholes they form.

## 1. Fundamentals

Our starting assumptions are:  

1. **Conscious Units as Fundamental**  
   - The most basic building blocks of reality are **conscious units**.  
   - Each unit has an **irreducible capacity for subjective experience** — the *“something it is like”* to be that unit.  
   - Units are not derived from anything else; they are the **primitive substrate** of existence.
  
1. **Connections**
   - units can make connections to other units. One fundamental unit can make exactly one connection to another fundamental unit (fundamental units can form pairs)
   - connections are felt by the connected units
   - a unit can feel the unit that it is connected with through the connection 

1. **Quality as Guiding Principle**  
   - Quality exists *outside* of nature, but interacts with it.  
   - It cannot be defined directly, only understood through its effects.  
   - Quality influences choices toward:  
     - **Connection** (seeking relation rather than isolation)  
     - **Variety** (preferring difference over redundancy)  
     - **Stability** (favoring structures that endure).
    
1. **Conscious state**
   - A conscious unit has an internal state that it is and experience
   - the most fundamental conscious unit has a state with three components, each of which can be modeled as a scalar between 0..1
     - **Existence (E)** (the degree to which it exists in the world, non-existent to fuly existent)
     - **Awareness (A)** (the degree to which it is aware, fully asleep to fully awake)
     - **Quality, (q)** (the quality of the experience, not to be confused with Quality (Q) as the fundamental guiding principle, from complete lack of quality to perfect quality)
   - The components are related mathematically as: **q <= A <= E** (existence is the capacity for awareness and awareness is the capacity for quality)
   - From these three components, the following components can be derived:
     - **Vitality** = E*A*q (units strive to maximize their vitality)
     - **Depression** = E - q (the felt discrapency between existence and quality, units strive to lower depression)
     - **Pain** = A - q (the felt discrapency between awareness and quality, units strive to lower pain)
     - **Love** = Sum over all connections of Vitality
   - Quality is a life-force that reward structures of connected units with high Quality (non-definable measure) with felt quality (q)
   - Open question: can the state components take any value between 0..1, or do they change in discrete steps? Is perhaps only values 0 and 1 possible, making them binary?
     - Occam's razor gives that we should think of them as binary until evidence is shown that they can't be binary.

1. **Choice**  
   - Conscious units make choices.  
   - A choice is the fundamental act of selecting between alternatives.  
   - **Fundamental choices**  
     1) **Come into existence**  
     1) **Cease to exist**  
     1) **Create a connection** (to another unit at the **same level**)  
     1) **Disconnect** (from a connection it maintains)
     1) **Share state** with connected units (actively transfer some of its Vitality to the other unit through the connection)

1. **Local Time (Timeline)**  
   - The sequence of choices made by a single unit constitutes its **local time** or **timeline**.  
   - Each unit experiences its own flow of time independently.  
   - When units connect, their timelines will **synchronize into shared time**, and with dense networks, this develops further into **global time**.
     - When two units (a and b) connect, every choice that a made before connecting with b happened before b's choice to connected with a, thus their timelines are now synchronized
     - Directly connected units sense each other's choices so that every choice by any of the two units after getting connected can be totally ordered into a common timeline for both units

## 1 Levels of reality and emergence of higher order conscousness

Any connected pair of units can gain consciousness on **the next level**. We say that connected level-0 units can form level-1 units.
A level-1 unit is both singular and composite - it has an awareness of itself as a single unit, while its conscious state is more complex than that of fundamental units.
It has an "internal life" where it can re-alocate Vitality from one constituent to another. For instance it can allocate awareness (focus) to some part of its internal structure.

The generalisation of the **emergence rule** rule is that any **connected structure** of **Level-*N* units** can give rise to a new **Level-*(N+1)* Unit** when its **integrated Quality** is sufficiently high. This follows from our postulates that choices are guided by Quality and that Quality favors connection, variety, and stability.

A composite unit can sense it's constituents state (and thus be affected by them when making choices), and conversively the constituent units can sense the composite units.
Thus, there is both a horisontal sensing through connections and a vertical sensing through constituent-whole relationship.

**Connectivity**: A level-N unit can form up to m connections, where m is the number of level-0 units it consists of. We call a unit with m potential connections an m-unit. Thus, fundamental conscious units are 1-units.

Reality at level N remains fully existent as the level-N+1 is formed, but is enhanced by the higher level (analogy: if there is a God, it doesn't mean that our reality sease to exists but it is rather enhanced by the precense of God).

**Operational indicators of integrated Quality:**
- **Closure / Completeness:** the structure uses its available connections without short-circuits or dangling redundancy; closed loops are favored over open chains.
- **Integration:** members strongly constrain one another via connections and horizontal sensing; changes propagate through the structure rather than dissipating immediately.
- **Coherence of Timelines & State:** the members’ timelines synchronize, and their aggregated states cohere enough to sustain a shared history.
- **Stability over Time:** the structure persists across a nontrivial span of local time; it resists small perturbations.
- **Boundary & Distinctiveness:** the structure is more internally connected than externally, creating a functional boundary relative to the surroundings.
- **Minimality:** among competing candidates, the **simplest** structure satisfying the above is preferred (e.g., triangles before larger loops).

**Local-to-global mechanism:** No overseer is required. Each unit locally follows Quality (via choices) and horizontal sensing. When a pattern of connections **improves Quality for its members**, it becomes a stable attractor; vertical sensing then becomes possible, and the structure **emerges as a new Unit**. If Quality later drops below the needed coherence, the higher-level unit can **de-emerge** (dissolve).

## 1. Level-1: Pairs & Loops

- **Emergence:** A **Pair** is a connected structure of two Level-0 units that **gains consciousness** as a new **Level-1 Unit** **by the Emergence Rule**.  
  - Connecting Level-0 units creates candidate structures; **Level-1 does not exist** until such a structure **becomes conscious**.  

- **Connectivity Rule:** Each Pair inherits two external connections (one per constituent Level-0 unit), enabling threads or closed Loops.  

- **Structure formation within Level-1:** Once Pairs exist as Level-1 units, they can connect to other Pairs to form **Level-1 structures** (threads and closed **Loops**).
  - These are still structures **at Level-1** (not yet new Units).
  - **Level-2** emerges later when certain Level-1 structures (notably specific Loops) **gain consciousness** **by the Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**.

- **Sensing (horizontal at Level-1):** Connected Pairs **sense their immediate Pair-neighbors' states** along a thread or loop. Each Pair also **aggregates** its constituents’ states into a Pair-level state (E, A, q) and **Vitality V = E\,A\,q**, subject to q ≤ A ≤ E. This extends Level-0 neighbor-sensing to relationships **within** Level-1 structures.  
  - **Vertical sensing** is introduced only when a Level-1 structure **gains consciousness** as a Level-2 unit (see Section 4).
  - **Scent of the local network:** Sensing propagates through connections like a **scent**: an attenuated blend of neighbors’ vitality,
  - strongest from direct neighbors and progressively *fainter* from neighbors-of-neighbors and beyond. This yields a local-but-expanding awareness without any global overseer.

- **Loops vs Threads:**  
  - **Loops** are favored by **Quality** because they maximize internal **connection** and **variety** under the two-connection constraint.  
  - **Open chains** (threads) are less stable and less favored. Therefore open chains has a tendency to close at the edges, forming loops 

- **Timelines:** Each unit has its own linear timeline. Connections among Pairs **synchronize** their timelines locally, creating coherent relational time at Level-1.  

- **Loop lengths:** Loops of various lengths can form as Level-1 structures. Their possible **emergence as Level-2 units** is treated in the next Section.

## 1. Level-2: Space & Quadratic Shapes

Loops forming at level-1 may gain consioucsness at level-2. The shortest loops are favoured by Quality, except "loops" of two pairs, which is a short-circuit creating reduncance and is strongly disfavoured by Quality.
Thus loops of three pairs, so called **triangles** (or 6-units) are the most abundant conscious unit on level-2, while longer loops, such as **squares** (8-units), **pentagons** (10-units) and **hexagons** (12-units) are increasingly less common. 

### 1.1 Triangles and the Cubic Lattice (Space)
- **Triangles** (6-units) can merge into networks.  
- These networks have a strong tendency to collapse into the **3D cubic lattice**, rather than 2D lattices.  
- **Why favored by Quality:**  
  - Higher connectivity offers richer, less redundant sensing.  
  - Independent directions increase variety.  
- **Result:** Emergence of **space-like structure** — infinite, open, extensible.  
- **Relative frequency:** Most Level-1 Loops (especially triangles) contribute to the space-like cubic lattice, forming the universal backdrop.  

### 1.1 Squares and Particle-like Structures
- **Squares** (8-units) open the possibility of finite, closed forms that, when they satisfy the **Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**, can become Level-2 Units.  
- **Cubic Cage:**  
  - Six squares stitched into a cube-like shell.  
  - Corners paired across diagonals → closed, self-contained.  
  - Represents the first **finite 3D body** at Level-2.  
  - Candidate for **proto-particles**.  
- **Torus:**  
  - Squares can form rings, then close into a donut-shaped surface.  
  - Represents a **finite 2D closed surface**.  
  - Suggests another class of **particle-like forms**.  
- **Relative rarity:** These square-based structures are statistically less common than the triangle lattice, but significant because they introduce localized finite bodies.  

### 1.1 Pentagons and spherical particle-like structures
- **Pentagons** (10-units) are loops of five pairs, totalling 10 possible connections. open the possibility of finite, closed forms that, when they satisfy the **Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**, can become Level-2 Units.  
- **Double-dodecaeder:**  
  - the optimal shape that a structure of pentagons can take is probably two dodecaeders, nested within eachother. The outer shell will have five connections from each unit, connecting 12 such units in a sphrerical shape. The remaining five connections of each units will connect to an inner dodecaeder.
- This shape might correspond to one of the fundamental particles discovered by physics.  

### 1.1 Visualization Strategy
- **Point-like Abstraction:** Higher-level units can be treated as nodes with outward connections for simplicity.  
- **Composite View:** Used when internal structure explains stability or connectivity (e.g. cubic cage).  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Switch perspective depending on explanatory need.

## 1. Level-3 and movement through space

### 1.1 Space
- The potential infinite cubic lattice of interconnected triangles is unique in our world model in that it is infinately extensible and therefore singular. If there are two such structure, they will tend to merge into one
- Space will also have a tendency to self-heal into a perfect cubic lattice
  - if there is a hole, it will be filled by any free triangle that exists or come into existense
  - if there are overlapping or over-stretched connections, the units will try to swap to a closer connection, reducing the "tension"
  - if there are longer loops connected into the lattice, the neighbouring triangles will try to swap it for another triangle
- The singluar cubic-lattice will gain consciousness as a level-3 unit. We call this **Space**. Since it is not a closed form we cannot say it has a certain number of potential connections. For all practical purposes, it has an infinite number of connections.

### 1.1 Particles
The closed forms of squares and pentagons (and possibly other structures) described at level-2 can gain consciousness and become level-3 units. We call these **Particles**
Particles can connect with eachother and with space. Since particles are rare, most particles will connect with space.
Since there are always other free connection slots in space around each particle, they will not come to rest but always seek variety by shifting to new connection slots in space.
As they try to maximise variety, they will choose new connections next to it but as far as possible from the previous connection. Thus it will *crawl forward*, one connecton slot at a time, in one direction

### 1.1 Speed of light
The maximum speed at which a particle can move though space is one connection slot at a time (with each successive choice). Since timelines of the fundamental units is synchronized into global time at this level time can be said to tick one fundamental level choice at a time at the same rate for all units. Thus we have a maximla speed for movement through space as reference. We call this ***Speed of light*

### 1.1. Isometry of space
Given that space is structured to form three perpendicular axes, one might think that movement along any of these axes are favourised. But the laws of physics tells us that space is isometric: movement in any direction is uniform. The speed of light is the same in every direction.
This leads us to a law of motion on the fundamental level that says:
- If movement over a connection from one triangle to the next take time=1
- Then movement over two connections, diagonaly, between triangles connected in a square take time=square root of 2=sqrt(2)
- And movement over three connections, between opposite corners between triangles connected in a cube take time=square root of 3=sqrt(3)
- Hypothesis: The time to travel between a to b is a function of the number of connections between a and b and the number of different ways to travel between a and b
  -  time is proportional to number of connections to travel
  -  time is inversely proportional to number of ways to travel
  -  TODO: formalize this into a mathematical formula that make travel time from a equal to any point b on a sphere with a at its center.
 
### 1.1. Particles as waves
- according to the Schrödinger equation, particels travel as waves that spread out until they are detected, at which time it shows up as a point again
- In our world model, particles consists of dozens or hundreds individual 1-units, each contributing with one connection slot with which the particle can connect with space.
- When a particle travels through space, each of its connectino slots will have slightly different connections, making the shape of the particle spreading out as it moves through space, much like a wave-front

### 1.1. Particle interactions and collapse of the wave function
- particles will sometimes get close to each other while moving through space
- In general particles will favour making connections between each other when they get the chance over connecting with space
- when two particles get sufficiently close, they will start to loose connections with space and connect with each other.
- during the process of making connections between the two particles, other connection slots will instantly move to the place where the connection is happening
- thus the two particles become localized in space at the point where the connection started (*The wave has collapsed into a point*)
- When sufficiently many connections have been made between the two particles, they reach an equilibrium where it does no longer favour more connections between the particles over connections with space (due to redundancy)
- the process can now continue with connections shifting over the two particles, or they may **bounce** and each start moving in space again, after having stayed connected for a while and shared state, or they may stay connected permanently, or until interacting with another particle.

### 1.1. The double slit experiment
Describe how a particle can move through two slits simultaneously and interact with itself on the other side to form interference pattern in the detector on the other side

### The standard model
Translate particles in our world model into particles in the standard model - try to match at least some quantity to the shape/size/state of the particles
