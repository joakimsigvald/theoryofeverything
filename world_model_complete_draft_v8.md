# A World-Model Combining Consciousness, Quantum Physics, Cosmology, and Life

## Glossary of Core Terms

### Fundamentals
- **Quality** — guiding principle outside nature; influences choices toward *connection*, *variety*, and *stability*.  
- **Choice** — the act of a conscious entity selecting between alternatives.  
- **Sensing** — the ability of a unit to perceive its neighbors and, indirectly, the broader network.  

### Structural Hierarchy
- **Unit** — general term for a conscious entity at any level.  
- **Level-0 Unit (Point)** — fundamental conscious entity; can form exactly one connection.  
- **Pair (Level-0 Composite)** — two Level-0 units linked; the first emergent structure.  
- **Loop (Level-1 Composite)** — closed chain of pairs. Loops can vary in length:  
  - **Triangle** (3 pairs → degree-6 connectivity)  
  - **Square** (4 pairs → degree-8 connectivity)  
  - Longer loops possible.  

### Level-2 Forms
- **Cubic Lattice (Space)** — extended 3D network formed by triangles; the basis of space-like structure.  
- **Cubic Cage** — finite 3D body formed by six squares stitched together; proto-particle candidate.  
- **Torus** — closed 2D surface formed from square loops stitched into a ring; another proto-particle form.  

### Conceptual Tools
- **Point-like Abstraction** — treating higher-level units as single nodes with outward connections.  
- **Composite View** — showing the detailed internal structure of a unit to explain connectivity.  
- **Layered Reality** — all levels remain real and active; higher levels emerge without erasing lower ones.  
- **Nested Sensing** — higher-level units sense their constituents, and constituents sense the wholes they form.

## 1. Fundamentals

Our starting assumptions are:  

1. **Conscious Units as Fundamental**  
   - The most basic building blocks of reality are **conscious units**.  
   - Each unit has an **irreducible capacity for subjective experience** — the *“something it is like”* to be that unit.  
   - Units are not derived from anything else; they are the **primitive substrate** of existence.  

2. **Quality as Guiding Principle**  
   - Quality exists *outside* of nature, but interacts with it.  
   - It cannot be defined directly, only understood through its effects.  
   - Quality influences choices toward:  
     - **Connection** (seeking relation rather than isolation)  
     - **Variety** (preferring difference over redundancy)  
     - **Stability** (favoring structures that endure).  

3. **Choice**  
   - Conscious units make choices.  
   - A choice is the fundamental act of selecting between alternatives.  
   - **Available actions:**  
     1) **Come into existence**  
     2) **Cease to exist**  
     3) **Create a connection** (to another unit at the **same level**)  
     4) **Disconnect** (from a connection it maintains)

4. **Local Time (Timeline)**  
   - The sequence of choices made by a single unit constitutes its **local time** or **timeline**.  
   - Each unit experiences its own flow of time independently.  
   - Later, when units connect, their timelines can **synchronize into shared time**, and with dense networks, this develops further into **global time**.  

(*Note: Sensing will be introduced later, once units begin to connect at higher levels.*)  


### 1.1 Emergence Rule (How structures become conscious)

Any **connected structure** of Level-*N* units can give rise to a new **Level-*(N+1)* Unit** when its **integrated Quality** is sufficiently high. This follows from our postulates that choices are guided by Quality and that Quality favors connection, variety, and stability.

**Operational indicators of integrated Quality (no equations needed):**
- **Closure / Completeness:** the structure uses its available connections without short-circuits or dangling redundancy; closed loops are favored over open chains.
- **Integration:** members strongly constrain one another via connections and horizontal sensing; changes propagate through the structure rather than dissipating immediately.
- **Coherence of Timelines & State:** the members’ timelines synchronize, and their aggregated states cohere enough to sustain a shared history.
- **Stability over Time:** the structure persists across a nontrivial span of local time; it resists small perturbations.
- **Boundary & Distinctiveness:** the structure is more internally connected than externally, creating a functional boundary relative to the surroundings.
- **Minimality:** among competing candidates, the **simplest** structure satisfying the above is preferred (e.g., triangles before larger loops).

**Local-to-global mechanism:** No overseer is required. Each unit locally follows Quality (via choices) and horizontal sensing. When a pattern of connections **improves Quality for its members**, it becomes a stable attractor; vertical sensing then becomes possible, and the structure **emerges as a new Unit**. If Quality later drops below the needed coherence, the higher-level unit can **de-emerge** (dissolve).



### 1.2 Internal State (what is sensed)

Each **Unit** carries an internal state summarized by three numbers in \[0, 1\]:  
- **Existence (E):** degree to which the unit exists.  
- **Awareness (A):** degree to which the unit is awake/aware.  
- **Felt Quality (q):** the unit’s *experienced* quality.

With the constraints: **q ≤ A ≤ E**.  
- A unit that does not exist (E = 0) cannot be aware (A = 0).  
- A unit may **exist without being aware** (E > 0, A ≈ 0): this is the **sleeping** state.  
- A unit cannot feel more quality than it is aware of (**q ≤ A**).  
- A large gap **(A − q)** can be experienced as **pain**; conversely, high q relative to context corresponds to **well-being**.

> Note on terminology: **Quality** (capital Q) remains the guiding principle *outside* nature. **Felt quality (q)** is the *internal, experiential estimate* of how much Quality is realized by the unit.

**Aggregated state — Vitality (V):**  
We define a unit’s **Vitality** as the product  
\[ V = E \times A \times q \in [0,1]. \]  
This scalar respects the constraints (if any factor is small, V is small), goes to 0 if any constituent is 0, and grows only when **existence, awareness, and felt quality rise together**.

**Discrepancy — Pain (δ):**  
\[ \delta = A - q \ge 0. \]  
Larger \(\delta\) indicates **unrealized Quality** relative to awareness and can drive future choices (e.g., to reconfigure connections).

## 2. Level-0: Fundamental Units

- **Nature:** Level-0 units (Points) are the most basic conscious entities. Each can make and maintain **exactly one connection**.  
- **Pair Formation:** Because each unit can only form one connection, the first stable emergent form is the **Pair**.  
- **Choice:** Level-0 units can (i) come into existence, (ii) cease to exist, (iii) create a single connection to another Level-0 unit, or (iv) disconnect. Given the one-connection capacity, the substantive structural decision is **whom to connect with**.  
- **Quality’s role:**  
  - Promotes *connection* (units do not remain isolated).  
  - Promotes *variety* (Pairs prefer distinct partners over double-links).  
  - Guides toward *stability* in these minimal forms.  
- **Sensing (neighbor):** When two Level-0 units connect, they **directly sense each other's state** — the tuple (E, A, q) and derived **Vitality V**. Unconnected units do not sense one another. This is the most primitive form of sensing.  
- **Reality:** All Level-0 units remain real and active even as higher levels emerge.

## 3. Level-1: Pairs & Loops

- **Emergence:** A **Pair** is a connected structure of two Level-0 units that **gains consciousness** as a new **Level-1 Unit** **by the Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**.  
  - Connecting Level-0 units creates candidate structures; **Level-1 does not exist** until such a structure **becomes conscious**.  

- **Structure formation within Level-1:** Once Pairs exist as Level-1 units, they can connect to other Pairs to form **Level-1 structures** (threads and closed **Loops**).
  - These are still structures **at Level-1** (not yet new Units).
  - **Level-2** emerges later when certain Level-1 structures (notably specific Loops) **gain consciousness** **by the Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**.

- **Connectivity Rule:** Each Pair inherits two external connections (one per constituent Level-0 unit), enabling threads or closed Loops.  

- **Sensing (horizontal at Level-1):** Connected Pairs **sense their immediate Pair-neighbors' states** along a thread or loop. Each Pair also **aggregates** its constituents’ states into a Pair-level state (E, A, q) and **Vitality V = E\,A\,q**, subject to q ≤ A ≤ E. This extends Level-0 neighbor-sensing to relationships **within** Level-1 structures.  
  - **Vertical sensing** is introduced only when a Level-1 structure **gains consciousness** as a Level-2 unit (see Section 4).

- **Loops vs Threads:**  
  - **Loops** are favored by **Quality** because they maximize internal **connection** and **variety** under the two-connection constraint.  
  - **Open chains** (threads) are less stable and less favored.  

- **Timelines:** Each unit has its own linear timeline. Connections among Pairs **synchronize** their timelines locally, creating coherent relational time at Level-1.  

- **Loop lengths:** Loops of various lengths can form as Level-1 structures. Their possible **emergence as Level-2 units** is treated in Section 4.

## 4. Level-2: Space & Quadratic Shapes

### 4.0 Sensing at Level-2
- **Horizontal sensing:** Adjacent Level-2 units (e.g., Triangles in the lattice) **sense their immediate neighbors** most strongly.  
- **Vertical sensing:** A Level-2 unit **senses its constituents** (e.g., the Level-1 Pairs forming the Loop), and those constituents **sense the composite** they help form.  
- **Scent of the local network:** Sensing propagates through connections like a **scent**: an attenuated blend of neighbors’ **(E, A, q)** (with **V** implicitly contributing), strongest from direct neighbors and progressively **fainter** from neighbors-of-neighbors and beyond. This yields a local-but-expanding awareness without any global overseer.



### 4.1 Triangles and the Cubic Lattice (Space)
- **Triangles** (degree-6 Loops) can merge into networks; when a qualifying loop satisfies the **Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**, it becomes a Level-2 Unit.  
- These networks have a strong tendency to collapse into the **3D cubic lattice**, rather than 2D lattices.  
- **Why favored by Quality:**  
  - Higher connectivity offers richer, less redundant sensing.  
  - Independent directions increase variety.  
- **Result:** Emergence of **space-like structure** — infinite, open, extensible.  
- **Relative frequency:** Most Level-1 Loops (especially triangles) contribute to the space-like cubic lattice, forming the universal backdrop.  

### 4.2 Squares and Particle-like Structures
- **Squares** (degree-8 Loops) open the possibility of finite, closed forms that, when they satisfy the **Emergence Rule (Section 1.1)**, can become Level-2 Units.  
- **Cubic Cage:**  
  - Six squares stitched into a cube-like shell.  
  - Corners paired across diagonals → closed, self-contained.  
  - Represents the first **finite 3D body** at Level-2.  
  - Candidate for **proto-particles**.  
- **Torus:**  
  - Squares can form rings, then close into a donut-shaped surface.  
  - Represents a **finite 2D closed surface**.  
  - Suggests another class of **particle-like forms**.  
- **Relative rarity:** These square-based structures are statistically less common than the triangle lattice, but significant because they introduce localized finite bodies.  

### 4.3 Visualization Strategy
- **Point-like Abstraction:** Higher-level units can be treated as nodes with outward connections for simplicity.  
- **Composite View:** Used when internal structure explains stability or connectivity (e.g. cubic cage).  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Switch perspective depending on explanatory need.  

### 4.4 Ontological Position
- **All levels persist.** Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 remain real and alive.  
- **Abstraction at higher levels.** For analysis, higher levels are modeled as point-like.  
- **Nested sensing.** Higher-level units sense constituents, and lower-level units sense the wholes.  
- **Result:** A layered but unified ontology.
