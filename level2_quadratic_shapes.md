# Level-2: Quadratic Shapes (Squares and Beyond)

## 1. Triangles (recap for context)
- Triangles (degree-6 loops) are the simplest and most stable form at Level-2.  
- They naturally merge into extended networks.  
- Quality favors these networks collapsing into the **3D cubic lattice** (rather than 2D triangular forms) due to higher connectivity and richer sensing.  
- Triangles thus explain the emergence of **space-like structure**: open, infinite, extensible.

## 2. Squares (degree-8 loops)
Squares (loops of four) are the next most likely form after triangles. With **8 potential connections**, they open up new possibilities:

### a. Cubic Cage (finite 3D body)
- Six squares stitched together to form a cube-like shell.  
- Each corner initially has two extra connection slots.  
- By “pairing” these across diagonals, the cage becomes a **closed, self-contained structure**.  
- Represents the first **finite 3D body** at Level-2, in contrast to the open lattice of triangles.  
- These could act like **proto-particles** embedded in the lattice.  

### b. Toroidal Structures (finite 2D surfaces)
- Squares can also connect in a looped chain forming a **ring**, and with further stitching, form a **torus** (donut-shaped surface).  
- Unlike the cubic cage (3D enclosed volume), the torus is a **2D closed surface**.  
- Demonstrates that quadratic loops can support **continuous finite topologies**, not just discrete cages.  
- Tori may represent another class of “particle-like” forms: extended but bounded.

## 3. Relative frequency
- The vast majority of Level-1 loops (especially triangles) tend to become part of the **space-like cubic lattice**, forming the continuous background of Level-2.  
- **Particle-like structures** (cages, tori) formed from squares are **rarer configurations**, statistically less favored but significant, since they introduce **localized, finite entities** against the infinite backdrop.

## 4. Visualization challenge
- Two ways to visualize higher-level units:  
  - **Point-like view:** each unit abstracted as a single node with n outward connections.  
  - **Composite-with-parts view:** show internal structure explicitly (e.g. each square’s four sides).  
- **Hybrid resolution:**  
  - For large-scale space: use **point-like abstraction** (simplicity).  
  - For distinctive forms (cages, tori): use **composite detail** (internal structure matters).

## 5. Ontological issue: What *are* higher-level units?
- Do Level-2 units preserve Level-1 structure, or collapse into new entities?  
- **Clarified position:**  
  - **All levels persist.** Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 remain real and “alive.”  
  - **Operationally point-like.** At higher levels, units are modeled as point-like with abstracted connectivity.  
  - **Nested sensing.** Higher-level units can sense their constituents, and lower-level units sense the wholes they form.  
- Thus, levels are **layered** rather than replaced, but we abstract as needed.
